**IMPORTANT: run this tasks separately**

**For correct using of code of this two tasks, you can use my example of creating server:**

- $ 'npm install http-server' local in this directory
- $ 'npm install -g http-server' globally
- $ 'http-server -c-1' to run this server
- $ use this adress: 'http://192.168.0.105:8080' http server will offer you this one

**_of course you can use your own server, but please change the url in fetch() method of async toVote function_**
